A Tech Talk about Domain Driven Design, given at Imagine Easy Solutions in New York City. We cover some of the basics of Domain Driven Design, such as:

- What is a "domain?"
- What is a "domain expert?"
- What is a "model?"
- How do I work with a domain expert to create a model?
- The building blocks of the model, including:
* Entities
* Value Objects
* Factories
* Services
* Repositories
- We also synthesize all of these things into a single, layered architecture. But most of that section got cut off because the camera died.

"Its premise is:

	- Place the project’s primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
	- Base complex designs on a model
	- Initiate a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem."
