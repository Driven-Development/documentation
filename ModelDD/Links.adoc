► " From the module set "Modeling Methods and Techniques"
In this module on model driven development we examine two approaches to the use of models to assist in the development of computer systems. In each case the purpose of the modeling is the same, to allow the complexities of the system to be represented in a more abstract, and therefore more understandable fashion."

► "...software engineering techniques which allow us to communicate the intent of programs to those outside of the engineering team..."

► Advantages are, "in short: productivity, quality, alignment."

- 1. MDD is faster
- 2. MDD is more cost-effective
- 3. MDD leads to increased quality
- 4. MDD is less error-prone
- 5. MDD leads to meaningful validation
- 6. MDD results in software being less sensitive to changes in personnel
- 7. MDD empowers domain experts
- 8. MDD lets advanced programmers focus on the hard stuff
- 9. MDD bridges the gap between business and IT
- 10. MDD results in software being less sensitive to changes in business requirements
- 11. MDD results in software being less sensitive to changes in technology
- 12. MDD really enforces architecture
- 13. MDD captures domain knowledge
- 14. MDD provides up-to-date documentation
- 15. MDD enables to focus on business problems instead of technology

===== Web Page ► 

1.     Not targeting all goals of Model-Driven Engineering
2.     Only using one modeling dimension: the dichotomy between PIM and PSM
3.     Focusing on generating new artifacts
4.     Using general purpose languages
5.     Using custom defined domain specific languages
6.     Using model transformations which are not fully executable
7.     Not testing the model
8.     Insufficient tooling
