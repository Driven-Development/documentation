*Caveats* _12:48_

* You will have to do this for a while before you will be faster.
* Intelligence is also an asset.
- Some things are too hard to test.
- Some tests are too trivial to be useful.
- Overtesting is possible.
- Exploratory coding without testing is OK.

===== Web page

► *Unit testing*

- "A unit test focuses on a single “unit of code” – usually a function in an object or module. By making the test specific to a single function, the test should be simple, quick to write, and quick to run."

► *TDD*

- "TDD or Test-Driven Development is a process for when you write and run your tests."
- Test-coverage
- Steps for the TDD process

► *BDD*

- "BDD is a set of best practices for writing great tests. BDD can, and should be, used together with TDD and unit testing methods."
- Addresses the issue of updating the test if you update the function, focusing on behaviour instead of implimentation.

TDD has started out as a promising method to write software, but test-first has since shown itself to not always be the correct way to do things. David Hansson also covers what to do once test-first is left behind.
